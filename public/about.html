<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi there! I’m an SDET (Software Development Engineer in Test) with a knack for making testing smarter, faster, and a
  little less painful (for both humans and machines). Over the years, I’ve sharpened my skills with tools like Selenium,
  Postman, and JMeter, not to mention the seamless integration into CI/CD pipelines. My goal? To streamline processes
  and cut testing efforts in half — or better, because who doesn't love efficiency? I also have the honor of being a
  BEAT Rockstar Award winner, though sadly, there was no actual guitar involved (I checked).

  I’m a firm believer that technology should work for you, not the other way around. Whether it's creating test scripts
  that behave like obedient minions or fixing that one pesky bug just before it hits production, I’m passionate about
  optimizing digital solutions. Oh, and logging test outputs? Don’t get me started — let’s just say I’ve danced with
  xUnit, Selenium, and dynamic test names enough to know where the pitfalls are. Let’s be honest, sometimes tests fail,
  but with the right tools, you can fail smart.

  When I’m not debugging code, you’ll probably find me diving deep into personal growth, whether it’s learning new
  skills or figuring out how to breathe properly while swimming (seriously, I’m getting there!). Based in the vibrant
  chaos of central north India, I embrace the local energy, especially when it comes to traditional fabrics like khadi.
  If you're here to talk tech or simply share a funny bug story, feel free to connect!
